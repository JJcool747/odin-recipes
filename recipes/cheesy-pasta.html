    <h2>Description</h2> 
        <p>A quick and simple to make pasta dish that is covered in a creamy cheese sauce,
            requiring a small quantity of household ingredients as well as being
            easily expandable for more than one serving.
        </p>    

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>    
        <ul>
            <li>70g of Cheddar Cheese</li>
            <li>300ml of Milk</li>
            <li>150g of Pasta</li>
            <li>25g of Plain Flour</li>
            <li>25g of Butter</li>
        </ul>    

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Fill a pan 3/4 with water and place it on the hob at a medium heat
                before adding the pasta to the pan as well as a pinch of salt.</li>
            <li>Now that the pasta is cooking we can begin on the cheese sauce
                add the butter and flour to a separate pan on medium heat and mix
                together as the butter melts.</li>
            <li>Once the two are mixed begin to add the milk in small potions mixing
                together aiming to get rid of all lumps.</li>
            <li>Now that all the milk has been added and the sauce has begun to thicken 
                we can cut the cheese into relatively small lumps and then add them to the pan.</li>
            <li>Now mix the cheese in until the lumps are removed before checking if the pasta is complete.</li>
            <li>Once the pasta is done cooking we can strain it before placing it in the pan with the cheese sauce 
                and mixing them together.</li>
            <li>Finally plate up and enjoy the meal.</li>
        </ol>
